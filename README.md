In the documentation you will find a Raspberry Pi tutorial from starter to more complex projects

All the [examples & tutorials](https://fs.keyestudio.com/KS3014) are in python, java and C++, including all the code source in each languaje and very clear electrical schema for each one

32 projects, from 0 (blinking a led) to practical like plant-watering system

The documentation include chips & sensors DataSheets
